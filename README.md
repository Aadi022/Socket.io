# Socket.IO

## What is Socket.IO?

Socket.IO is a JavaScript library used to create real-time, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers. It is built on top of WebSockets but provides additional features such as automatic reconnection, broadcasting, and event handling, making it easier to build interactive web applications.

Socket.IO consists of two parts:
- A **server-side** library for Node.js
- A **client-side** library that runs in the browser

These two parts communicate seamlessly, enabling live, event-driven communication over the web.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Communication**: Enables instant data exchange between client and server.
- **Bi-Directional Event-Based Communication**: Both the client and server can send and receive messages.
- **Automatic Reconnection**: Automatically attempts to reconnect when the connection is lost.
- **Multiplexing Support**: Allows handling multiple connections over a single channel.
- **Fallback Options**: Uses WebSockets when possible, but falls back to HTTP long polling if necessary.
- **Room and Namespace Support**: Helps in grouping and targeting specific sockets.

## Where is it Used?

Socket.IO is widely used in applications that require live interaction, such as:

- **Chat applications**
- **Online multiplayer games**
- **Collaborative tools (e.g., document editing, whiteboards)**
- **Live dashboards and analytics**
- **Real-time notifications**
- **IoT device communication**
